Operator Precedence:
You can force an operation using parentheses. 
unary operators: - +
multiplicative: * / %
additive: + - 
assignment: = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=


Data Conversion:
You can change the types of data.
You can make only widening conversions not narrowing conversions. 
Three types of data conversion: arithmetic promotion, assignment promotion, cast

arithmetic promotion:   result = 5/5.0  result will hold 1.0.  The int gets promoted to a double.
assignment promotion:   double result = 6;  the 6 gets promoted to 6.0 through assignment.
cast:  result = (double)6/50;
